#' Convert osmdata polygons into lines
#'
#' Street networks downloaded with `add_osm_object(key = "highway")` will
#' store any circular highways in `osm_polygons`. this function combines
#' those with the `osm_lines` component to yield a single \pkg{sf}
#' `data.frame` of all highways, whether polygonal or not.
#'
#' @param osmdat An `osmdata_sf` object.
#' @return Modified version of same object with all `osm_polygons`
#' objects merged into `osm_lines`.
#'
#' @note The `osm_polygons` field is retained, with those features also
#' repeated as `LINESTRING` objects in `osm_lines`.
